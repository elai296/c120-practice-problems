Jack's Question: Whatâ€™s the difference between a relative, fixed, absolute and statically positioned element?
static positioning is the default for every element, it just means the element will flow into the page as it normally would.

relative positioning will position the element relative to itself, nothing will happen if no positioning attribute is defined, like top, right bottom or left, it enables z - index to be applied, it also limits the scope of absolutely positioned child elements.Any element that is a child of the relatively positioned element can be absolutely positioned within that block

absolute positioning removes the element from the flow of the page and use the positioning attribute to set its position

fixed positions the element relative to the viewport

sticky positions the element like its static until the user scrolls past it, if there's extra height on the parent element it will be fixed until the parent element runs out of height
