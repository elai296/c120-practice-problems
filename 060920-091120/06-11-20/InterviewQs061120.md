window.alert("Alert text here.");
* Confirm box:a Used when user verification is requirsed. It will return TRUE if the user clicks OK, and FALSE if the user clicks CANCEL.
window.confirm("Confirm text here.");
* Prompt box: Used if the user needs to input something before proceeding. When the user inputs a value and presses OK, the prompt box will return the input value. If the user clicks CANCEL without inputting a value, the input value will return as null.
