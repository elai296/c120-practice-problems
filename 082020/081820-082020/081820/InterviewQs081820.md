# Heegu Park's Philz Coffee Interview Questions:

# What is JavaScript?
 JS is one of the core technologies of the web, it provides functionality to web pages and enables client side page behavior. It is a high level, just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm programming language.

# HTTP requests?
 it is a request to api with GET, POST, DELETE, PUT. HTTP requests enable communications between clients and servers

# How does JavaScript function work?
 JavaScript runs web pages and reads code from top to bottom and loads what in needs to. It has methods built into it where it can activate when the user interacts with the web page.

# What is the difference between JavaScript and other programming languages?
 The difference between JavaScript and other programming languages is it is prototype based whereas other programming languages are class based. JavaScript has classes of its own but it's just objects dressed as classes.

# What is SHIM?
 A shim is typically something written specifically to maintain backwards compatibility.

# What is a component?
 Components are code that can be reused like functions and classes

# What is a React component?
 They are building blocks of react app, there can be pure components, class components, classless component

# What is hoisting?
 Hoisting is where the functions or variables are moved to the top of the scope. So an example would be calling a function anywhere on the same document and it would be able to read it cause it is being read at the top of the scope.

# What is a prototype in JavaScript?
 A prototype in JS is a property on the standard objects. It is the chain that allows access to JS built in methods or otherwise custom defined prototype methods.

# How does API work?

# Difference between graphsql vs rest?
 Rest API's fetches 3 times and provides additional information, it over fetches. It has been around for a decent amount of time longer so it more used. GraphQL on the other hand, did not come up with a stable version until 2018. GraphQL only fetches what is needed.

# Tell me about the way of testing your applications?
 At the moment I test and troubleshoot my applications via the browser developer tools and see if the expected behavior of my code is ideal. I do know there are test suites that could help me in making better tests and am working towards learning them in the future.

# What if you replace ‘if(n <= 2)’ by ‘if(n = 2)’?
 One tests if n is less than or equal to two while the other assigns the value 2 to n
