// Analog Clock Angles
// Challenge: Take a standard 12 hour clock.At any given time, the hour and minute hand form an angle representing the time.
// For example, 3: 15 is 7.5 degrees, 12: 30 is 180 degrees.Write a function that will compute the smallest angle between
// the hour and minute hands for a given time.Function should support switching between a 12 hour and 24 hour clock.
