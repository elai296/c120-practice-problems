### What is an API and how to make API call?
An application programming interface (API) allows application developers to bypass traditional web pages and interact directly with the underlying service through function calls.

It is the software intermediary that delivers a request to the server and then relays a response back to the client.
API Call
Simply put, the moment you add an endpoint to a URL and send a request to a server, this is what counts as making an API call. For example, when you log on to any app or ask a question via a browser, you are actually making an API call.
In a nutshell, an API call is a process that takes place when you send a request after setting up your API with the correct endpoints. Your information is transferred, processed, and feedback is returned back.
