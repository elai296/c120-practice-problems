## Question: What are the different phases of ReactJS component lifecycle?

There are four different phases of React component’s lifecycle:
1. Initialization: In this phase react component prepares setting up the initial state and default props.

3. Updating: In this phase, the component get updated in two ways, sending the new props and updating the state. This phase covers shouldComponentUpdate, componentWillUpdate and componentDidUpdate lifecycle methods.
4. Unmounting: In this last phase, the component is not needed and get unmounted from the browser DOM. This phase include componentWillUnmount lifecycle method.

## Question: Why should not we update the state directly? 
Answer:   
If you try to update state directly then it won’t re-render the component.
Instead use setState() method. It schedules an update to a component’s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering
